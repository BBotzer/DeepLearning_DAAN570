    "## More on Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "In just this section,\n",
    "we have taught you all the linear algebra\n",
    "that you will need to understand\n",
    "a remarkable chunk of modern deep learning.\n",
    "There is a lot more to linear algebra\n",
    "and a lot of that mathematics is useful for machine learning.\n",
    "- For example, matrices can be decomposed into factors, and these decompositions can reveal low-dimensional structure in real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are entire subfields of machine learning\n",
    "that focus on using matrix decompositions\n",
    "and their generalizations to high-order tensors\n",
    "to discover structure in datasets and solve prediction problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this course focuses on deep learning. And we believe you will be much more inclined to learn more mathematics once you have gotten your hands dirty deploying useful machine learning models on real datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "So while we reserve the right to introduce more mathematics much later on,\n",
    "we will wrap up this section here.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are eager to learn more about linear algebra,\n",
    "you may refer to `Strang.1993,Kolter.2008,Petersen.Pedersen.ea.2008`.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors are basic mathematical objects in linear algebra.\n",
    "* Vectors generalize scalars, and matrices generalize vectors.\n",
    "* Scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors have zero, one, two, and an arbitrary number of axes, respectively.\n",
    "* A tensor can be reduced along the specified axes by `sum` and `mean`.\n",
    "* Elementwise multiplication of two matrices is called their Hadamard product. It is different from matrix multiplication.\n",
    "* In deep learning, we often work with norms such as the $L_1$ norm, the $L_2$ norm, and the Frobenius norm.\n",
    "* We can perform a variety of operations over scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We defined the tensor `X` of shape (2, 3, 4) in this section. What is the output of `len(X)`?\n",
    "1. For a tensor `X` of arbitrary shape, does `len(X)` always correspond to the length of a certain axis of `X`? What is that axis?\n",
    "1. Run `A / A.sum(axis=1)` and see what happens. Can you analyze the reason?\n",
    "1. When traveling between two points in Manhattan, what is the distance that you need to cover in terms of the coordinates, i.e., in terms of avenues and streets? Can you travel diagonally?\n",
    "1. Consider a tensor with shape (2, 3, 4). What are the shapes of the summation outputs along axis 0, 1, and 2?\n",
    "1. Feed a tensor with 3 or more axes to the `linalg.norm` function and observe its output. What does this function compute for tensors of arbitrary shape?\n"
