    "* With softmax regression, we can train models for multiclass classification.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In this section, we directly implemented the softmax function based on the mathematical definition of the softmax operation. What problems might this cause? Hint: try to calculate the size of $\\exp(50)$.\n",

    "1. What solutions you can think of to fix the two problems above?\n",
    "1. Is it always a good idea to return the most likely label? For example, would you do this for medical diagnosis?\n",
    "1. Assume that we want to use softmax regression to predict the next word based on some features. What are some problems that might arise from a large vocabulary?\n"
