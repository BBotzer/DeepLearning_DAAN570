    "Neurons, layers, and models provide abstractions to build Deep Neural Networks.\n",

    "it turns out that we need to define components that are larger than an individual layer but smaller than the entire model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A component consist of repeating patterns of *groups of layers*. Such\n",
    "design patterns are common in practice to implement complex networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement these complex networks, we introduce the concept of a neural network *block*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A block could include a single layer, multiple layers, or the entire model itself!\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of working with the block abstraction is that they can be combined into larger blocks, often recursively. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a programing standpoint,  a block is represented by a *class*.\n",
    " - Any subclass of it must define a `forward propagation function`, transforming its input into output and also storing any necessary parameters.\n",
    "- Some blocks do not require any parameters at all.\n",
    "- A block must possess a `backpropagation function` to calculate gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, due to some behind-the-scenes magic\n",
    "supplied by the auto differentiation (`autograd`) when defining our own block,\n",
    "you only need to worry about the block parameters and the forward propagation function.\n",
